There are no graphics involved.

The computer prompts the user to choose a number between 1 and 9 as his/her first move. You can print a 3 by 3 grid with numbers in it to indicate what number is for what square. Once the user chooses a number the computer chooses a square that is not occupied and reprints the grid with X for the user and O for the computer.
